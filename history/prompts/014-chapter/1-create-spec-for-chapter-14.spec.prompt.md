# Create Specification for Chapter 14

## User Input

```
→ chapter_14.md
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive feature specification for Chapter 14 content creation. The specification includes:

- User scenarios for creating, integrating, and formatting chapter 14 content
- Functional requirements covering content creation, formatting, consistency, and continuity
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for content quality and user experience
- Identified key entities and edge cases

The specification addresses the creation of a chapter_14.md file with appropriate content length (2,000-3,000 words) and ensures narrative continuity with adjacent chapters. All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were resolved with reasonable assumptions.

## Outcome

Specification is ready for the next phase: `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
