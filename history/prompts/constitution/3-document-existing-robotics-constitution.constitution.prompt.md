## Prompt

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

Documenting the existing constitution for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics project. The constitution is already well-defined with specific focus on:

- Core principles around embodied intelligence, sim-to-real fidelity, systems thinking, reproducibility, engineering rigor, and industry alignment
- Clear scope and coverage for the course modules
- Technical standards for ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and related platforms
- Writing and pedagogy standards
- Quality assurance and assessment alignment

The constitution is comprehensive and specific to the project's needs for creating a textbook and course companion for humanoid robotics.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Documented existing project constitution
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created PHR for existing .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Constitution is ready for use in project
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution is well-structured for the specific robotics project
