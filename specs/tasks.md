## Dependencies

- Chapters 9-12 (P2 priority) can begin after P1 chapters have initial content
- Chapter 14 (P3 priority) must wait until at least Chapter 13 is substantially complete
- All formatting and validation tasks depend on content completion

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- T013-T021 [US1] and T022-T030 [US2] can be executed in parallel by different writers
- T031-T039 [US3] and T040-T048 [US4] can be executed in parallel by different writers
- T049-T057 [US5], T058-T066 [US6], T067-T075 [US7], and T076-T084 [US8] can be executed in parallel
- T085-T093 [US9] and T094-T105 [US10] can be executed in parallel after earlier chapters are complete

## Implementation Strategy
- Start with MVP: Complete core concepts sections of P1 priority chapters first
- Iterate through phases: Build complete content incrementally across all chapters
- Validate continuously: Ensure quality standards are met at each stage
- Focus on consistency: Maintain uniform terminology, style, and approach across all chapters
- Preserve structure: Maintain frozen chapter organization while expanding content
